## Event Target :

<p>Understanding the concept of Event Target is essential for handling events in JavaScript. By attaching event listeners to specific elements and leveraging the Event Target, developers can create interactive web pages that respond to user actions. Whether it's capturing events, removing listeners, or dispatching events, the Event Target provides a powerful mechanism for building dynamic and engaging web applications.</p>

What is an Event Target? 
<br> <br>
In JavaScript, an Event Target refers to an object that can receive events and handle them. Typically, an Event Target is an HTML element, such as a button, input field, or the document itself. It serves as a destination for event dispatching and allows event listeners to be attached to it.

Event Propagation:
<br> <br>
Events in JavaScript propagate through the DOM tree, starting from the target element and traversing up through its ancestors (capturing phase) before descending back down to the target element (bubbling phase). The Event Target plays a vital role in this propagation process.

During event propagation, the event object's target property always refers to the element where the event originated. This property allows event handlers to access the specific element that triggered the event, even if the event propagated through multiple elements.

What is an JSON in JS? 
<br> <br>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is widely used for representing structured data. It is based on a subset of JavaScript syntax, but it is language-independent and can be parsed and generated by various programming languages.

In JavaScript, JSON format represents data as key-value pairs similar to JavaScript objects. JSON uses a simple and human-readable text format, making it easy to understand and work with. 
<br>
In the context of JSON format in JavaScript, here are the main points to focus on:

<ui>
<li>JSON uses a key-value pair structure: Data in JSON is represented as key-value pairs. The key is always a string enclosed in double quotes ", followed by a colon :, and then the corresponding value.
</li>
<li>Values can be of different types: JSON supports various data types for values, including strings, numbers, booleans, null, objects, and arrays.
</li>
<li>Objects in JSON: Objects in JSON are enclosed in curly braces {}. They consist of a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique within the object.
</li>
<li>Arrays in JSON: Arrays in JSON are enclosed in square brackets []. They hold a list of values, which can include objects, arrays, or other data types.
</li>
<li>Strings in JSON: Strings in JSON must be enclosed in double quotes ". They can contain alphanumeric characters, special characters, and escape sequences.
</li>
<li>Numbers in JSON: Numeric values in JSON can be integers or floating-point numbers.
</li>
<li>Booleans in JSON: JSON supports boolean values represented as true or false.
</li>
<li>Null in JSON: JSON has a special value null to represent the absence of a value.
</li>

The Local storage :

<br>
Local storage is a web browser feature that allows web applications to store data persistently on a user's device. It provides a simple key-value storage mechanism and is often used to store small amounts of data for web applications.
<br>
Key-Value Storage: Local storage stores data in a key-value format, similar to an object. Each piece of data is associated with a unique key. The key is used to retrieve or update the corresponding data value.
<br>
Persistence: Unlike regular JavaScript variables that lose their values when a page is refreshed or closed, data stored in local storage persists even when the web page is closed or the browser is restarted. The data remains accessible until it is explicitly removed or cleared.
<br>
Scope: Local storage is specific to a particular domain and is not shared across different domains or across different browser tabs or windows.
<br>
Storage Limitations: Local storage has a maximum storage capacity, typically several megabytes per domain. However, it's important to note that the actual limit can vary depending on the browser implementation and user settings.
<br>
Data Format: Local storage stores data as strings. If you want to store complex data structures such as objects or arrays, you need to convert them into strings using methods like JSON.stringify(). Similarly, when retrieving data from local storage, you need to parse the string back into its original format using JSON.parse().
<br>
API: Local storage can be accessed using the localStorage object, which provides methods to interact with the stored data, such as setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), and clear(). These methods allow you to store, retrieve, remove, and clear data from local storage.
<br>
Local storage is often used for scenarios where you need to persist user preferences, session data, or small amounts of data needed across multiple pages of a web application. It provides a convenient and efficient way to store and retrieve data on the client-side.
